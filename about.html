    <h1>About the Magic of Glass</h1>
    <img src="./images/bellaandaleen.png"/>
    <p> Aleen started a YouTube channel in the fall of 2023 with the hope of spreading the joy of glass art to other seniors.  Her channel 
        has many tutorials on glass art along with remembrances from over the years.  Born in Waynesville, North Carolina as a Depression baby, 
        she remembers events like the bombing of Pearl Harbor, rationing during WWII, and growing up in the Blue Ridge Mountains. Visit her 
        channel at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@aleensglassmagic">Aleen's Glass Magic</a>.

    <h2>About Aleen</h2>
    <p>Aleen recently turned 90 years old but there's no slowing down for her. After a career teaching chemistry at Clemson University, 
        she took her first class in stained glass at the age of 73. Then she took another.  And then another. Then she discovered fused 
        glass.  Where stained glass involves cutting, foiling, and soldering pieces of glass, fusing takes certain kinds of glass and melts 
        them together in a kiln. She loves the technical aspects of the glass and the uncertainties of what will happen in the kiln.  Her 
        favorite method is called raking.  Raking is where the glass is heated in the kiln and then the kiln is opened momentarily and the glass 
        is literally raked to mix colors and patterns and create special effects.

    <h2>About Bella</h2>
    <p>Bella was abandoned by her previous owner inside a residence.  The landlady found her and brought her up to a rescue center where Aleen 
        happened to be looking for a companion with whom to weather the Covid lockdown.  Aleen has a long history with poodles and it was love at first 
        sight.  Bella was the perfect companion and helped keep Aleen active with daily walks.  Through walking Bella on the downtown sidewalks
        around the gallery, Aleen has met any number of people who have become friends and/or students.  You might be suprised how many other 
        merchants in Uptown Martinsville have dog treats just waiting for Bella's visits.
